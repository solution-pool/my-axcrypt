About Axantum.AxCrypt.Mono

This assembly contains platform specific implementations for desktop Mono / desktop Windows.

At this time, Mono and Windows are treated to be compatible and use the same implementation.

A platform specific implementation assembly should implement IRuntimeEnvironment, and the
interfaces exposed by methods and properties in that interface. This is currently:

IFileWatcher, ILauncher, IRuntimeFileInfo, ITiming and IWebCaller.

Code coverage is not required to be 100% here, but what reasonable can be tested should be.

FxCop should pass without complaint.
