        Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        AxCrypt version 2 is intended to extend and improve on AxCrypt 1.x in various ways,
        based on the almost 10 years of experience with version 1.</p>
    <h1>
        Main Design Goals</h1>
    <p>
        The main design goals lists features and behavior that will be realized by version
        2. Some are the same as in version 1, some are different etc.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Portability - AxCrypt was designed to use and exploit the Win32 API as much as possible.
            AxCrypt2 will instead focus on cross platform portability, primarily for Linux and
            Mac, and secondary for mobile platforms (the idea being that differences will be
            reduced in time). This will be achieved by use of .NET/Mono for as much of the core
            as possible:
            <ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Third party libraries used must also be Mono compatible. Initially only BouncyCastle
                        is used, and that for the ZLib implementation and the potential to use the cryptography
                        features in the future.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Simpler build process - AxCrypt has a very complex build process with extensive
            scripting for various reasons. Some customization of the build will be required,
            but the goal is to keep it as simple as possible - possibly even at the expense
            of some convenience.</li>
        <li>No installation will be required, but will be offered for additinal functionality.
            The regular AxCrypt executable should as far as is possible be a simple executable
            without any need for installation. There may be some need for ILMerge, but if it
            turns out we&#39;re only using ZLib from third party source it may be better to
            include it via source than to require ILMerg.</li>
        <li>MSI-based installer via Wi.</li>
        <li>Less dependence on advanced features of Visual Studio - Should be buildable and
            compileable with Visual Studio Express.</li>
        <li>More forgiving for fatal errors during uninstallation - an uninstall should probably
            never give up. It may ask the users permission to continue if an error is encountered,
            but it really should complete.</li>
        <li>No scripting logic to handle OEM adaptions. This will be handled by branching in
            the repository instead - but all OEM-variable texts and data should be concentrated
            to as few files as possible.</li>
        <li>No use of registry for user settings. User settings are stored in a monitored XML
            file, which is stored in a platform-dependent user-local location. Global settings,
            if any are stored in an XML file in a platform-dependent location, typically the
            same folder as the program or in application data local settings (%LOCALAPPDATA%).</li>
        <li>Less use of advanced features - much more robust handling of automatic reencryption,
            possibly at the expense of some manual operation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>
        Main Anti Goals</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Less worry about clear-text in memory. Keeping the local system clean to this extent
            is really hard. We may use the SecureString class, but it&#39;s very inconvenient
            and questionable all-in all it&#39;s not only strings that needs to be kept safe.
            Using ProtectedMemory is not really a solution either since the clear text needs
            to be there anyway at least briefly.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h1>
        Design Details</h1>
    <h2>
        Decrypt-Modify-EncDecrypt-Modify-Encrypt</h2>
    <p>
        The current implementation in AxCrypt works reasonably well in many cases, but is
        very platform dependent, and very hard to port. It&#39;s also rather sensitive to
        various smarter applications, and their creative behavior. Notably Open Office,
        and proably more recent versions of Microsof Office as well.</p>
    <p>
        A more robust scheme should depend as little as possible on advanced platform features.
        Waitable applications are probably ok, but non-returning and too-quick-returning
        applications must be handled. Turning this on it's head... Opportunistic re-encryption?
        As soon as it's modified, and we can get exclusive access, re-encrypt. Keep a "transaction
        log", recording what is in the temp folder, where it came from and thus should be
        re-encrypted to.</p>
    <p>
        Use of platform dependent file watching should be ok, in Windows use file system
        watcher, otherwise a polling implementation.</p>
    <p>
        Deletion of a sucessfully re-encrypted file that could be opened exclusively should
        be ok. If it's kept in memory by the app, and then re-saved nothing bad should happen,
        as long as we know where it came from we can still re-encrypt.</p>
    <p>
        If we can keep the transaction log in plain text, that will facilitate. This should
        be doable, since the only sensitive information is the file names, and they will
        be removed from&nbsp; the log when the corresponding file is removed.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A file is decrypted (if required, it may already be decrypted), and the application
            launched. The fact is noted in the user transaction log, which contains the source
            path, the temp path, the key thumbprint and the time of the original. Nothing more
            happens in this thread.</li>
        <li>A watcher thread will check if a file is modified later than what is recorded in
            the transaction log. Every time a modification is noted, and the clear text file
            can be accessed exclusively, it is re-encrypted. The watcher thread could be driven
            by file system watchers, but for simplicity sake it just polls every X seconds,
            or when it is kicked. When something happens, the wiper thread is kicked to ensure
            that things happen rapidly.</li>
        <li>A wiper thread will check every Y seconds if a file in the transaction log can be
            accessed excusively with no change. Y is dynamic and stored in the transaction log,
            so it can grow and shrink. If the file can be access exclusively, it is wiped. This
            is really the only weakness, an application could let go of all handles, and still
            expect to read more from the file - if so it will be somewhat surprised to see it
            gone...</li>
        <li>(Conditional wiping is handled by associating applications with enabled and disabled
            automatic wipe. An unknown associated application prompts the user, with the recommendation
            being automatic.This is platform dependent, but the idea is that there should be
            a pre-populated list of the most common applications.)</li>
        <li>Deferred wiping occurs during system shutdown, logout and with a manual dialog.>The
            transaction loThe transaction log can also mark a directory as encrypted, in which
            case files placed there will be automatically encrypted (as long as AxCrypt is running
            of course).</li>
        <li>(A user request for encryption of a plain-text-file, or a directory, is actually
            accomplished by entering it into the transaction log, and kicking the watcher thread.
            Maybe...)</li>
        <li>Command line operations typically mimic the same operations as performed by the
            GUI, as if entered via the GUI (with some obvious extensions) - but they must be
            possible to run synchronously so that operations are waitable. For real batch operations,
            a new non-interactive flag will be introduced, which will cause no GUI at all to
            be invoked, and a purely synchronous execution model - no transaction log etc.
            <h2>
                Inter Process Communication</h2>
            <p>
                This should be minimized and simplified... But how? We want and need a resident
                process for reencryption and wiper threads, and we probably need to keep keys there.</p>
            <p>
                The shell extension and similar components can launch AxCrypt as a child process,
                and can thus provide a pipe for IPC. How this secondary delegating process actually
                communicates with the primary work process is less of a problem since it's an internal
                issue. But since we can now use the secondary delegating instance as a proxy, there's
                a single simple interface to use along side with the command line.</p>
            <p>
                In any way, command line launching is always GUI-free, thus bypassing all complex
                windowing problems of AxCrypt 1. A client that wants to provide a GUI will have
                to do so by itself.</p>
            <p>
                The command line can have an option specifying a file descriptor to write status
                messages, progress etc to. These will be text-free, since it's supposed the client
                will have to handle localization issues. Text-only, localized messages, are provided
                on stderr (possibly only if requested).</p>
            <p>
                This means the shell extension passphrase dialog and progress dialog will by necessity
                be managed by the shell extension. Progress information etc will have to be communicated
                from the main instance via IPC, as well as passphrase info. Should be ok.</p>
            <p>
                Options for IPC are:</p>
            Options for IPC are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Shared Memory</li>
                <li>Shared Files (This is probably the only portable one).</li>
                <li>Named Pipes</li>

            </ol>
            <h2>
                Primary GUI Worker/Secondary Proxy design</h2>
            <p>
                The same basic design is used as in AxCrypt 1, but the difference is that the secondary
                processes never have any GUI actions. They may emit output to standard output and/or
                standard error, just like a command line utility. (They also offer the capability
                to accept commands via stdin instead, and emit protocol rather than text responses
                and progress feedback etc via stdout.) The secondary processes are &#39;waitable&#39;
                for typical operations such as encrypt and decrypt. Real progress is shown via the
                primary tray process, but the shell extension can show a message box with an animation
                and reference to the tray process.</p>
            <p>
                AxCrypt started without arguments starts the tray app in full visible window mode.
                With arguments it can be started in tray mode, or as a secondary.</p>
            <p>
                The primary process, at least in Windows, is a tray application with full GUI interaction.
                It may be started as a stand-alone program or as the result of for example Shell
                Extension call via the command line.</p>
            <p>
                IPC between Primary and Secondary is implemented using... ?.
                <p>
                    For now, the decision is to go with shared files, but the mechanism will be implemented
                    as a concrete implementation of an interface so it can upgraded/changed at a later
                    time. Also, for now, the shared file will be written in clear text, no encryption
                    altough wiped as soon as possible. The window is small, and in most cases a wipe
                    should be effective. Focus is not on paraoid keeping of key material secure on the
                    local PC.</p>
                <h2>
                    GUI behavior</h2>
                <p>
                    The GUI will be a app with drag and drop and file open dialogs to select files for
                    encryption or decryption. Passphrase entry will be a typical modal dialog box. Progress
                    indication will be a separate element in the window, and also visible in the tray
                    icon (for windows) and when hovering. Pop-ups from the tray can be used to indicate
                    things like files being re-encrypted etc.
                </p>
