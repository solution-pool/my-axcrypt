The source code is minimally modified in order to compile. The project is modified to
target the .NET 4.0 profile instead of the client profile to be consistent with the
other projects in the Windows build.

For consistency, the assembly is signed with the Axantum strong name key if available.

The unit tests are not included, since AxCrypt has it's own unit tests, and to keep the
payload to a reasonable level. It's essentially a binary dependency, the only reason to
include the source code is to ensure that it can be rebuilt from source code only, which
is important for a cryptographic application.
