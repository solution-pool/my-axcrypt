About Axantum.AxCrypt.Mono.Test

This assembly contains best-effort tests for Axantum.AxCrypt.Mono . By the very
nature of things, since these are the implementations that interact directly with
the platform, it is not always practical to actually design tests. But when this
is feasible, it should be done.

Code coverage is not required to be 100% .

FxCop should pass without complaint.
